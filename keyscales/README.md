# Key scales for Lishi Key Cutter
Printable scales to measure and (most importantly) cut the keys on Lishi key cutter.

The resulting A4 PDF page has the scale multiple times on it. You will probably destroy one scale after a while.
If you cut out the cutter part with a precision knife and place it on the Lishi Cutter, you get a very precise code-to-key machine (as precise as your fine motor skills) + a measure scale.

The actual scales are for the mostly used keys in the Czechoslovakia + I tried to create one scale for Schlage (5-6 cuts, 0.015in depth increments) which is more popular in the west. However, the Freecad file is easily configurable for almost anything - just change the lengths ;)
