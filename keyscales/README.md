# Key scales
Printable scales to measure and (most importantly) cut the keys on Lishi/Klom key cutter.
If you cut out the cutter part with a precision knife, you get a very precise key-to-code machine.

The actual scales are for the mostly used keys in the Czechoslovakia + I tried to create one Schlage scale more popular in the west. However, the Freecad file is easily configurable for almost anything - just change the lengths ;)
