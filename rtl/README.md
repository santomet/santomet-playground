# RTL helpers

# rtlswitch
script for switching between original DVB-T drivers and the osmo-sdr. Basically just loading and unloading driver modules. Supports classic RTL2382U and RTL2382P (Astrometa DVB-T2) for which it renames frontends to use built-in Panasonic DVB-T2 demodulator as default in VLC
### Enabling DVB-T:
- UNPLUG device!
- run rtlswitch -o
- PLUG IN device
- If your device is Astrometa DVB-T2 or clone, you have to rename your frontends to use it in vlc - run rtlswitch -o

### Enabling osmo-sdr:
- UNPLUG device!
- run rtlswitch -r
- PLUG in device!

# programstream
script which makes VLC to stream (via HTTP) a particular DVB-T/2 program very efficiently by using #transcode with video&audio copying - which actually remuxes these particular streams. This works in more cases than just #duplicate with a program specified and much better than tvheadend.

This way streaming 1080p/50fps channel consumes only 10-20% of one Cortex A53@1GHz (maybe up to 40% on A7) and it works flawlessly. Furthermore, VLC does this in multiple threads.
### programstream switches:
- -p | --program INT specifies program number in transponder
- -f | --frequency INT specifies frequency of transponder in Hz
- -t | --dvbttwo 1/0 specifies if using DVB-T2 (default is yes)
- -P | --port INT specifies open HTTP port for streaming

# restream
script that makes VLC to ingest some kind of stream and then restreams it. For example, if you have slow connection at the place where you have your antenna, but fast connection anywhere else, you can multiply your streaming possibilities this way...
### restream switches:
- -u |Â --url URL the streaming url to ingest
- -p | --port INT the port for streaming out
